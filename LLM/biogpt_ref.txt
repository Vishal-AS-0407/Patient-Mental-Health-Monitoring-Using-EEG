QUESTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Analyze how high arousal, low valence, low dominance, and the presence of error-related potential affect emotional state, 
    cognitive load, decision-making, and learning capabilities. Specifically, how do these factors influence cognitive function, 
    memory, and decision-making, both in stressful and non-stressful situations?
    

ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In stressful situations, high arousal and low valence are associated with an increase in negative emotions and a decrease in positive emotions, while high dominance is associated with increased positive emotions and decreased negative emotions, as well as a reduction in cognitive load and cognitive flexibility. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The results of this study suggest that high arousal / low valence and high dominance / low arousal are important factors to consider when evaluating the effects of stress on cognitive performance, emotional states, and decisions-making capabilities, especially in the context of stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Stress and Emotion: From Basic Research to Clinical Practice."

[Figure: see text] CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that high levels of arousal, high valence, and low dominance are key factors in determining the emotional state and cognitive functioning of individuals, and that these factors also affect decision-making.Implications for clinical practice and future research: These findings suggest that it may be beneficial for clinicians to focus their attention on these factors in order to improve their ability to assess and treat stress-induced disorders, such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and substance abuse, and to reduce the negative impact of these disorders on individuals' cognitive functioning and their quality of life.Key Words: Stress, Emotion, Cognition, Decision-Making, High Arousal, Low Valence, High Dominance, Low Error-Related Potentials, Depression, Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Substance Abuse, Alcohol, Nicotine, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Cannabis, Heroin, Psychostimulants, Marijuana, Fentanyl, Benzodiazepines, Amitriptyline, Oxycodone, Dextromethorphan, Methylphenidate, Vagin.This Technical Bulletin is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), European Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ESTT), International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR), US Department of Defense (USDOD), University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ), John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
