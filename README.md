# üß† **EEG Signal Analysis and Recommendation System**

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive system that uses **EEG signals** to provide real-time health analysis and personalized recommendations. The system processes EEG data to assess various physiological and psychological states, including:
- Mental states  
- Cognitive load  
- Emotions  

The signals are first subjected to **biomedical signal preprocessing**, then fed into deep learning models trained on specialized datasets targeting these states. The outputs from these models are processed by a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate a detailed health report. This report provides cumulative insights into a person's well-being, including recommendations for:
- Personalized activities  
- Dietary plans  
- Medical advice  

By correlating multiple EEG signals, the system can identify potential health risks and offer tailored suggestions, such as:
- Rest or sleep recommendations  
- Focus and cognitive load management  
- Consultation with a healthcare provider  

The system offers a holistic view of a person's health, enabling them to make informed decisions for a healthier lifestyle.
